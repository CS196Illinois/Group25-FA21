CS 196 Project Notes
* Project Overview
   * Fitness website
      * Focuses on tracking calories, sleep, diet, and overall health and wellbeing
      * We want to have data stored so that it is easy to access and manipulate, and we’ll be able to make further analysis and graphs on what we have collected. 
* Technologies/Languages to use
   * Django
      * Used for data storage and retrieval, essentially the backend of the website.
      * We can implement different forms for data storage which we can then retrieve for data analysis purposes. This can be used to make a graph of calories consumed over time, or variance in sleep.
      * Python
         * The language used to code with Django
   * Web Development
      * HTML
         * The backbone of the website we are developing, since HTML is used to organize every element that will be on the website.
         * Can be used to place buttons, make headers, and other elements that can be used to make our website functional.
      * CSS
         * Used to style our website, and make it aesthetically pleasing
      * JavaScript
         * Used to create any functions or algorithms
